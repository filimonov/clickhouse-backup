## How to store backups on NFS, backup drive or another server via SFTP
Use 'rsync'
'rsync' supports hard links with means that backup on remote server or mounted fs will be stored as efficiently as in the '/var/lib/clickhouse/backup'.
You can create daily backup by clickhouse-backup and sync backup folder to mounted fs with this command:
`rsync -a -H --delete --progress --numeric-ids --update /var/lib/clickhouse/backup/ /mnt/data/clickhouse-backup/` or similar for sync over ssh. In this case rsync will copy only difference between backups.
